Ms. Peeso’s Shelter for Peculiar Pets is a virtual pet shelter that houses homeless pets that tend to be on the exotic side.

*New* We have recently started accepting robotic pets as well.

You are able to feed or hydrate all of our organic pets in the shelter.

TIP These virtual pets can die if there health level goes too low.

Have fun playing with all of our rare, organic and robotic creatures.
